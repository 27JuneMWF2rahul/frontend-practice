    <p class="q">1. What is <u>JavaScript</u> ?</p>
    <p>=> JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of
        web pages, whose implementaions allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is
        an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.</p>
    <p>JavaScript was first known as Livescript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the
        excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name
        Livescript. The general-purpose core of the language has been embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other
        web browsers.</p>
    <p>The ECMA-262 Specification defined a standard version of the core JavaScript language.
    <ul type="circle">
        <li>JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language</li>
        <li>Designed for creating network-centric applications.</li>
        <li>Complementary to and integrated with Java.</li>
        <li>Complementary to and integrated with HTML.</li>
        <li>Open and cross-platform</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="q">2. What is the use of isNaN function?</p>
    <p>=> NaN stands for Not a Number. It's a special floating point value that is used to indicate that a result is
        undefined or unrepresentable. I personally see it as the result returned in embedded systems when a sensor is
        disconnected.</p>
    <p>NaN is not less than, greater than, equal to or not equal to any numeric value. it's also not equal to itself.
        that mean that you can't test whether a variable contains NaN simply by testing whether it is equal to NaN. It
        can't ever be. Thus, we have the isnan macro to allow us to write the code to test for it.</p>
    <p class="q">3. What is negative Infinity?</p>
    <p>=> negative Infinity is the smallest number.</p>
    <p>On the number-line, the right of zero are positive numbers starting from -1. If somebody ask me how far can you
        go right on the number line, I would say negative infinity.</p>

    <p>=>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Undeclared </b>variables is a variable that has been declared without 'var' keyword. domoVar = 'hello
            world'.</li>
        <li><b>undefined</b>is a variable that has been declared but no value exists and is a type of itseif
            'undefined'.</li>

    <p class="q">7.What is the difference between ViwState and SessionState?</p>
    <p>=>
    <ol>
        <li><b>ViwState:</b>It is maintained at oly one level that is page-level. Changes made on a single page is not
            visible on other pages. information that is gathered in view state is store for the clients only and cannot
            be transferred to any other place. View state is synonymous whith serializable data only.
            <ul type="square">
                <li>ViwState has a tendency for the persistence of page-instance-specific data. When view state is used.
                    the value posted of a particular page persist in the browse area that the clint is using and post
                    back only when the entire operation is done. the dada of the previos page is no longer available
                    when anthoer page is loaded. Also, Data is not secure in this case because it is exposed to clients.
                    Encryption can be used for data security.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>SessionState:</b>It is maintained at session-level and data can be accessed axross all pages in the web
            application. The information is stored wthin the server where the information is stored.
            <ul type="square">
                <li>SessionState has the tendency for the persistence of user-specific dada and is maintained on the
                    server-side. This data remains available until the time that the session is completed or the browser
                    is closed by the user. the session state is onlyvalid for type objects.</li>

    <p class="q">8. What is === operatoe?</p>
    <p>=> The strict Equality operator(===)checks Whether its two operands are equal, returning a Boolean result. Unlike
        the quality operator, the strict equality operator always considers operands of different type to different.</p>

    <p class="q">9.How can the style/class of an element be changed</p>
    <p>=>
        To change the styles of all elements a specific class.
    <ol>
        <li>Use the querySelectorAll() method to get a collection of the elements whith the specific class.</li>
        <li>use the forEach() method to iterate over the collection</li>
        <li>On each iteration. use the style object to change the element's styles.</li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
        <li>var elem = document.getElementById('demo');</li>
        <li>elem.style.color='red'; And to chenge class you have to use classList object
            <ul type="square">
                <li> var elem = doucument.getElementById('demo);</li>
                <li>// Remove 'fi' class from it </li>
                <li>elem. classList.add('mi')</li>
                This is how you can change style and class of an element from JavaScript.

            After the File system File is impotend then,the writeFile() opertion is called. The writeFile() method is
            used to write into the File in JavaScript. The syntax of this method is as follows-
            <ul type="square">
                <li><b>Parth -</b> The first parameter is the parth of the file or the name of the file into which the

                    <ul type="square">
                        <li>If there is a file already, then the contents in the file are deleted and the input which is
                            given by the user will get updated or if the file is not presentn, then the file with than
                            will be created in the file is not present, then the file with that will be created in given

                <li><b>callBackFunction-</b> The third parameter is the function which is the call back function which
                    contains the error as the parameneter and shows the fault if the write operation Gails.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Syntax:</b> <span>readFile(path, format,callBackFuc)</span>
            Reading from the File
            <br>
         After the file system module is imported, the reading of the file in JavaScript can be done by using the readFile() function.
         <ul type="square">
            <li>Path - The first paramenter is the parth of the test file from which the contents are to read. if the current location or directory is the same directory where the file which is to be opened and read is located then, only the file name has to be given.</li>
            <li>Format- The second parameter is the optional paramenter which is the format of the text file, The format can be ASCIL,UTF-8.etc</li>

    <p>12. How can you convert the string of any base to an integer in JavaScript?</p>
    <p>=>In JavaScript parseInt() function (or a method) is used to convert the passed in string parameter or value to an integer value itself. This function returns an integer of base which is specified in second argument of parseInt() function. 

        parseInt() function returns Nan( not a number) when the string doesn’t contain number. 
        
        Syntax:
        
        parseInt(Value, radix)
        It accepts string as a value and converts it to specified radix system (any desired numerical value passed by a user) and returns an integer (corresponding to the passed in numerical radix value). Program to convert string to integer: </p>

        <p class="q">16. How can a page be Forced to load anotherpage in JavaScript?</p>
        <p>=>
            In this article, we will see how can a page be forced to load another page in JavaScript.

Approach: We can use window.location property inside the script tag to forcefully load another page in Javascript. It is a reference to a Location object that is it represents the current location of the document. We can change the URL of a window by accessing it.

Syntax:
<br>
&lt; script &gt;
<br>
    window.location = &lt; Path / URL &gt;
    <br>
    &lt;/script&gt;
    <br>
Example:


&lt;script&gt;
    window.location = "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/"
    &lt;/script&gt;
So in the above example, we see that by changing the window.location Object inside Javascript we can change the URL of our window and thus successfully load any page forcibly from our Javascript without any href tag. We will build a small working sample to learn it practically. 

Below is the step by step implementation:

Step 1: Create a file named index.html. Add a heading and two buttons to it. One button forcefully loads a page with a live URL and the other button loads a local HTML page. In the &lt;script&gt; tag we have two functions, one loads gfg home page, and the second loads a local HTML page using window.location property.

        <p class="q"> 17.What are the disadvantages of using innerHTML in JavaScript?</p>
        <p>=>
            The innerHTML property is a part of the Document Object Model (DOM) that is used to set or return the HTML content of an element. Where the return value represents the text content of the HTML element. It allows JavaScript code to manipulate a website being displayed. More specifically, it sets or returns the HTML content (the inner HTML) of an element. The innerHTML property is widely used to modify the contents of a webpage as it is the easiest way of modifying DOM. But there are some disadvantages to using innerHTML in JavaScript.

Disadvantages of using innerHTML property in JavaScript:

The use of innerHTML very slow: The process of using innerHTML is much slower as its contents as slowly built, also already parsed contents and elements are also re-parsed which takes time.
Preserves event handlers attached to any DOM elements: The event handlers do not get attached to the new elements created by setting innerHTML automatically. To do so one has to keep track of the event handlers and attach it to new elements manually. This may cause a memory leak on some browsers.
Content is replaced everywhere: Either you add, append, delete or modify contents on a webpage using innerHTML, all contents is replaced, also all the DOM nodes inside that element are reparsed and recreated.
Appending to innerHTML is not supported: Usually, += is used for appending in JavaScript. But on appending to an Html tag using innerHTML, the whole tag is re-parsed.
Example:

<p id="geek">Geeks</p>
title = document.getElementById('#geek')

// The whole "geek" tag is reparsed
title.innerHTML += '<p> forGeeks </p>'
Old content replaced issue: The old content is replaced even if object.innerHTML = object.innerHTML + 'html' is used instead of object.innerHTML += 'html ''. There is no way of appending without reparsing the whole innerHTML. Therefore, working with innerHTML becomes very slow. String concatenation just does not scale when dynamic DOM elements need to be created as the plus' and quote openings and closings becomes difficult to track.
Can break the document: There is no proper validation provided by innerHTML, so any valid HTML code can be used. This may break the document of JavaScript. Even broken HTML can be used, which may lead to unexpected problems.
Can also be used for Cross-site Scripting(XSS): The fact that innerHTML can add text and elements to the webpage, can easily be used by malicious users to manipulate and display undesirable or harmful elements within other HTML element tags. Cross-site Scripting may also lead to loss, leak and change of sensitive information.
