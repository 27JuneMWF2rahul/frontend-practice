    <h1>Apply Call Bind</h1>

    <p><b>Call</b> is a function that helps you change the context of the invoking function. In layperson's terms, it
        helps you replace the value of this inside a function with whatever value you want</p>

    <p><b>Apply</b> is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an array as
        an argument</p>

    <p><b> Bind </b> a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later with the new context
        of this that is provided.</p>
